<b> What is RegistryCloud ? </b>

RegistryCloud is a data collection, sharing, and processing platform mainly focused on the healthcare domain. The platform provides its users to various user-friendly tools that have the functionality of data creation, storage, and processing.

<b> The creation idea of RegistryCloud </b>

The idea of the creation of RegistryCloud comes from addressing the problems which are existed in both the Turkish and global markets.
These problems are as follows;

1- Existing platform solutions of data collection/processing are produced specifically for the relevant projects and are difficult to use in other projects.

2- The existing solutions are costly and occasionally hard to install or maintain

3- The free products which target our problems are often not secure due to the nature of open-source software since healthcare data contains sensitive information.

4- The existing solutions have not had the functionality of data processing.

the idea of the RegistryCloud was born to bring a solution to these problems by Our supervisor Fuat Akal
