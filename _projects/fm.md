The form module is a tool that researchers can create forms to be filled for patients. The tool itself provides five different types of questions which are true/false, selectable, text, date, and numeric type. In addition, users can set constraints like whether this question is optional or not, or they can set a range for these questions. With these customizable settings, users can create very specific and easily usable forms and store the answers to further process the data. In addition due to customizable constraints, they can prevent false entry data which is common in these kinds of surveys.
